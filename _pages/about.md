Synposis
======
In H2O -Footprints in the Sand-, Hirose Takuma is a blind middle school student, though the cause for his blindness is undetermined. After his mother died unexpectedly, it left a deep emotional scar on him, causing him to become lonely and reserved. Due to this, Takuma moves from the city out into a rural area to live with his uncle and Takuma is enrolled into a new middle school. There, he meets several new girls, including the firm and obstinate Kohinata Hayami, the kind and obliging Kagura Hinata, and the cheerful and mysterious Otoha.

In √ after and another, there are new after stories for two of the heroines from H2O (Hayami and Hinata), plus new routes for Yui and Hamaji/Yukiji, the latter of which also unlocks Maki's route.

A version merging both games into one was later released, H2O √ after and another Complete story Edition.

Where to purchase
======

The game can be purchased legally from DMM ([https://dlsoft.dmm.co.jp/detail/mnphs_0007/](https://dlsoft.dmm.co.jp/detail/mnphs_0007/)), but a Japanese proxy/VPN may be necessary to purchase it.

***This patch is intended for use on `H2O √ after and another Complete story Edition` and will not work on standalone H2O or Root. Before installing, it is recommended you back up your game files.***

Using an archive extracting program, such as 7zip or WinRAR, extract the files to the game folder that contains `BGI.exe`. Overwrite any conflicting files. 

[Video Troubleshooting](#video-troubleshooting)
======
Some computers may have problems with video playback. The audio will play but the screen will remain black.
This affects typically older VNs that do not rely on middleware to render videos, such as H2O. This can possibly be fixed by installing the `K-Lite Codec Pack`, but we have not been able to get that working either. Hence, we have a work around. This works for anyone who has an integrated GPU (part of your CPU).

**If you have determined that you are experiencing this issue**, refer to the instructions below (Windows 11, this also applies to Windows 10):

| Image | Instruction |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/ATdzIkg.png) | Open `Settings`. |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/qPcWUol.png) | Go to the `System` tab. |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/F3x42JG.png) | Select the `Display` menu. |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/HkWebLW.png) | Select the `Graphics` menu. |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/WLbJ4bt.png) | Select `Browse` under `Add an app`. Look for `BGI.exe` in your H2O installation. |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/14bOwVf.png) | Look for `Ethornell - Buriko General Interpreter ver 1.xx` in the list of programs here, click on it, then select `Options`. |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/DSCV4ID.png) | Check `Power Saving` to switch the program to use your integrated GPU only, then `save`. |

This is not a definitive solution as some computers do not have integrated graphics, such as many Ryzen CPUs.
