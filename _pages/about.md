Synposis
======
*H2O*'s story revolves around Takuma Hirose, a blind young male junior-high school student, though the cause for his blindness is undetermined. After his mother died an unexpected death, it left a deep emotional scar on him, which caused him to become very lonely and reserved. Due to this, Takuma and his uncle move from the city out into a rural area and Takuma is enrolled into a new junior-high school. At his new school, he meets several new girls, though three of whom he gets to know the most out of anyone else. They are, the firm and obstinate Hayami Kohinata, the kind and obliging Hinata Kagura, and the cheerful and mysterious Otoha. As Takuma interacts with these girls, his medical condition gradually begins to heal.

[From [Wikipedia](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H2O:_Footprints_in_the_Sand)]

*√ after and another* contains new after stories for the original heroines, Yui's and Maki's routes and several short stories.

Download and Installation
======

Download the english patch here:

[Google Drive]() || [MediaFire]() 


***Before installing, it is recommended you back up your game files.***

Using an archive extracting program, such as 7zip or WinRAR, extract the files to the game folder that contains `BGI.exe`. Overwrite any conflicting files.

Before you play... (video playback issues on some computers)
======
Some computers may have problems with video playback due to known issues in recent Nvidia GPU drivers. The audio will play but the screen will remain black.
This affects typically older VNs that do not rely on middleware to render videos, such as H2O. This can possibly be fixed by installing the K-Lite codec pack, but Studio Frisay has not been able to get that working either. Hence, we have a work around.

Refer to the instructions below (Windows 11, this also applies to Windows 10):

| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/14bOwVf.png) | Look for `Ethornell - Buriko General Interpreter ver 1.xx` in the list of programs here, click on it, then select `Options`. |
| ![Editing a markdown file for a talk](https://i.imgur.com/DSCV4ID.png) | Check `Power Saving` to switch the program to use your integrated GPU only, then `save`. |
